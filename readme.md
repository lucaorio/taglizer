## Rationale

I made this small project in a rush. I needed to parse a reasonably large bulk of `.mp3`, `.flac`, and `.opus` to identify any missing tag in the metadata.

Given a very specific folder/file structure:

```
- Discography
  - Artist
    - Album
      - Song (flac|mp3|opus)
      - Song (flac|mp3|opus)
    - Album
      - Song (flac|mp3|opus)
  - Artist
      - Album
      - Song (flac|mp3|opus)
  ... etc
```

Taglizer looks for these tags in the metadata of every file:

```
Title
Album
Artist
Album Artist
Track Number
Total Tracks
Disc Number
Total Discs
Date
Label
Genre
Cover (true or false)
```

The output is `html` based (barebone styling). Any missing tag is highlighted in the _album table_ with a red cell.
